doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow\nyou come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now\nTake my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance\nAnd now I’m singing like\n\nGirl you know I want your love\nYour love was handmade for somebody like me\nCome on now follow my lead\nI may be crazy don’t mind me \nSay boy let’s not talk too much \nGrab on my waist and put that body on me\nCome on now follow my lead\nCome come on now follow my lead\n\nI’m in love with the shape of you\nWe push and pull like a magnet do\nAlthough my heart is falling too\nI’m in love with your body\nLast night you were in my room \nAnd now my bed sheets smell like you \nEvery day discovering something brand new\nI’m in love with your body\n\nOh I X 4\nI’m in love with your body\nOh I X 4\nI’m in love with your body\nOh I X 4\nI’m in love with your body\nEvery day discovering something brand new\nI’m in love with the shape of you \n\nOne week in we let the story begin\nWe’re going out on our first date\nYou and me are thrifty\nSo go all you can eat \nFill up your bag and I fill up a plate\nWe talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour\nAnd how your family’s doing ok\nleave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat\nTell the driver make the radio play\nand I'm singing like\n\nGirl you know I want your love\nYour love was handmade for somebody like me\nCome on now follow my lead \nI may be crazy, don’t mind me\nSay boy let’s not talk too much \nGrab on my waist and put that body on me\nCome on now follow my lead\nCome come on now follow my lead\n\nI’m in love with the shape of you\nWe push and pull like a magnet do\nAlthough my heart is falling too\nI’m in love with your body\nLast night you were in my room \nAnd now my bed sheets smell like you \nEvery day discovering something brand new\n\nWell I’m in love with your body\nOh I x 4 \nI’m in love with your body\nOh I x 4\nI’m in love with your body\nOh I X 4\nI’m in love with your body\nEvery day discovering something brand new\nI’m in love with the shape of you \n\nCome on be my baby come on X 8\n\nI’m in love with the shape of you\nWe push and pull like a magnet do\nAlthough my heart is falling too\nI’m in love with your body\nLast night you were in my room \nAnd now my bed sheets smell like you \nEvery day discovering something brand new\n\nWell I’m in love with your body\nCome on be my baby come on X 6\nEvery day discovering something brand new\nI’m in love with the shape of you \n \nAbout Ed Sheeran: \nEd Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. \n\nHis incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. \n \nIn 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’. \n \n#EdSheeran #ShapeOfYou #divide",true,true,3362005201
